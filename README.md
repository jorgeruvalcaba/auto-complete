# auto-complete

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies
installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (typically comes with Node.js installation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jorgeruvalcaba/auto-complete.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd auto-complete
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
  npm i
```

## Development

To start the development server and run the project locally, use the following
command:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

This will build and serve the project, and provide you with a local development
URL to access the application in your browser.

As you make changes to the source code, Vite.js will automatically rebuild and
update the application in real-time.

## Additional Scripts

The project comes with other useful scripts that you can run using
`npm run <script-name>`:

- `test`: Runs the project tests.
- `lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
